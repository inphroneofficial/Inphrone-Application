# InPhrone - 1 Minute YC Video Script (Final Polish)

## 🎬 FINAL YC VIDEO SCRIPT — Polished for Delivery

### [0:00–0:05 | Smile, relaxed shoulders, steady eye contact]
**"Hey YC, I'm GTK, solo founder of Inphrone, built from Hyderabad."**

➡️ *Warm tone — first impression matters. Show friendly confidence.*

---

### [0:06–0:18 | Controlled tone, light hand movement for rhythm]
**"₹500–1000 crore films flop because studios assume what people want — they never ask.**

**One random reel goes viral because it connects.**

**That's when I realized: no one captures what audiences want before creation."**

➡️ *Pause slightly after "connects" — emphasize the insight moment.*

---

### [0:19–0:34 | Confident, dynamic delivery — lean slightly forward at 'I built']
**"So I built Inphrone — where audiences share one opinion per week per category to keep data pure, trend-accurate, and duplicate-free.**

**They earn points, badges, and real rewards.**

**Creators — from YouTubers to OTT studios — get live dashboards with global audience insights, updated weekly."**

➡️ *Use your hands gently to emphasize "audiences" and "creators."*

---

### [0:35–0:50 | Steady voice, serious but inspired tone]
**"The beta launches in two weeks — free for now to grow users.**

**Next comes subscriptions and entertainment-focused ads.**

**Goal: 100 users in 30 days, then creator adoption.**

**YC can scale this from Hyderabad to Hollywood — literally."**

➡️ *Slight smile on "Hyderabad to Hollywood" — it's a memorable hook.*

---

### [0:51–1:00 | Warm smile, finish with conviction]
**"Inphrone is the world's first opinion data layer for creators.**

**Let's make content that truly resonates.**

**Thank you."**

➡️ *Pause one second after "resonates," then a small nod.*

## 🎥 Recording Tips

### Environment:
- Quiet, neutral background (white wall or shelf)
- Natural daylight or a ring light in front of you
- Avoid echo (curtains or soft background help)

### Dress:
- Plain solid-color shirt (navy, black, or grey)
- Avoid prints, logos, or bright reflections

### Body language:
- Sit or stand straight
- Keep one hand visible (looks natural)
- Maintain eye contact with camera lens — not screen

### Voice:
- Speak with clarity and slight modulation — not too fast
- Sound excited but calm, like a visionary who's already started execution

## 💡 Key Messaging Points

**Problem**: ₹500-1000 crore films flop because studios assume instead of asking audiences

**Insight**: Random reels go viral because they connect — but there's no systematic way to capture what audiences want before creation

**Solution**: Inphrone - where audiences share 1 opinion/week/category (pure data, no duplicates)

**Business Model**: 
- Beta launch in 2 weeks (free for growth)
- Then subscriptions + entertainment ads
- Goal: 100 users in 30 days → creator adoption

**Vision**: Scale from Hyderabad to Hollywood with YC

**Tagline**: "The world's first opinion data layer for creators"
