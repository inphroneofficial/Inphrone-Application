## [0:00-0:10] Opening Hook

## [0:10-0:30] The Problem
**[Screen: Split screen showing three personas with pain point callouts]**

**Voiceover:**
"Today's entertainment industry is broken. Studios spend hundreds of thousands on market research that takes months. Creators launch content hoping audiences care. And audiences? They have zero say in what gets made.

The result? Billions wasted on content nobody wants. Creators burned out. Audiences ignored."

**[Screen: Statistics appearing]**
- "$100K+ per research project"
- "6-12 month delays"
- "70% of content fails to find audience"
