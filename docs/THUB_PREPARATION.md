## 📋 Expected Questions & Answers

### Section 1: Business Overview

#### Q1: "What does INPHRONE do in simple terms?"

**Answer:**
> "INPHRONE is a people-powered entertainment intelligence platform. We collect genuine opinions from entertainment consumers about what content they want to see - movies, TV shows, music, games, OTT content. We then aggregate this data and provide actionable insights to entertainment studios, OTT platforms, and content creators to help them make data-driven decisions about what content to produce."

#### Q2: "What problem are you solving?"

**Answer:**
> "Currently, entertainment decisions are made based on gut feelings, past performance data, or expensive market research. Studios spend billions on content that flops because they don't truly understand what audiences want BEFORE production. INPHRONE provides real-time, genuine consumer demand data before a single rupee is spent on production."

#### Q3: "Who are your target customers?"

**Answer:**
> "We have two customer segments:
> 1. **B2C (Free)**: Entertainment consumers who share opinions and earn rewards
> 2. **B2B (Paid)**: Film studios, OTT platforms (Netflix, Hotstar, Prime), TV networks, music labels, and gaming companies who pay for insights"

#### Q4: "What's your revenue model?"

**Answer:**
> "Our revenue comes from B2B subscriptions:
> - **Starter**: ₹50,000/month - Basic insights dashboard
> - **Professional**: ₹2,00,000/month - Advanced analytics + API
> - **Enterprise**: Custom pricing - Full data access + custom reports
> 
> We also offer pay-per-report options for smaller studios."

### Section 2: Technology & Innovation

#### Q5: "What technology stack are you using?"

**Answer:**
> "We use a modern, scalable architecture:
> - **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
> - **Backend**: Lovable Cloud (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
> - **Version Control**: GitHub for code repository
> - **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend hosting with custom domain
> - **Security**: Row-Level Security, encrypted data, role-based access
> - **Mobile**: Progressive Web App + Capacitor for native apps"

#### Q6: "What makes your technology unique/patentable?"

**Answer:**
> "We have three patentable innovations:
> 
> 1. **People-Powered Entertainment Intelligence System**: Our algorithm aggregates individual opinions into industry-actionable insights using demographic weighting, geographic clustering, and sentiment analysis.
> 
> 2. **InphroSync Daily Engagement System**: A gamified daily question mechanism that maintains user engagement while collecting structured data through swipeable interfaces and streak-based incentives.
> 
> 3. **Your Turn Community Question System**: A democratic content creation model where users propose and vote on questions, creating community-driven market research."

#### Q7: "How is this different from social media analytics?"

**Answer:**
> "Critical difference: Social media captures reactions AFTER content releases. We capture DEMAND BEFORE production. Our data is:
> - **Intentional**: Users actively share what they want
> - **Structured**: Categorized by genre, format, platform
> - **Demographically tagged**: Age, location, preferences
> - **Actionable**: Directly tied to production decisions"

## 🎤 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Think of us as the 'Google Trends for Entertainment Production Decisions' - we're capturing demand before supply exists."

## ⚠️ Potential Concerns & Responses

### Concern: "How do you ensure data quality?"

**Response:**
> "Multiple quality measures:
> - Email verification
> - Duplicate detection
> - Spam filtering
> - Engagement patterns analysis
> - Community moderation"

### Concern: "What if studios don't pay for this data?"

**Response:**
> "Studios already spend millions on market research. We offer:
> - Lower cost than focus groups
> - Continuous data vs one-time surveys
> - Larger sample sizes
> - Real-time insights
> Pilot programs will prove value before full commitment."

### Concern: "Can't studios just use social media?"

**Response:**
> "Social media shows reactions to existing content. We capture demand for non-existent content. A studio can't gauge interest in a movie concept on Twitter - they can on INPHRONE."
