## 🛡️ Implemented Protections

### 1. Trademark Indicators (™)

The trademark symbol (™) has been added to the Inphrone brand name across all key touchpoints:

| Location | Element |
|----------|---------|
| Navigation Bar | INPHRONE™ logo text |
| Footer | Inphrone™ brand name |
| Auth/Sign-up Page | INPHRONE™ header |
| SEO Meta Tags | Inphrone™ in page titles |
| Legal Notices | All trademark references |

**Note:** The ™ symbol indicates that Inphrone is being used as a trademark. Once trademark registration is complete, this can be upgraded to ® (registered trademark).

### 2. Hidden Developer Warning

A comprehensive legal notice has been embedded at the very top of `index.html`:

```html
<!--
================================================================================
⚠️ LEGAL NOTICE - INPHRONE™ PROPRIETARY CODE

This codebase, including all associated intellectual property, algorithms, 
data structures, and brand assets, is the exclusive property of Inphrone™ 
and its founder. Unauthorized copying, modification, distribution, reverse 
engineering, or scraping of this code or its outputs is strictly prohibited 
and may result in legal action.

© 2026 Inphrone. All Rights Reserved.
Trademark Registration Pending.
